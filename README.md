Sirbot has been archived as I no longer want to continue this project. As a result of a handful of issues regarding API interaction in the other cogs, I've decided to remove them all and keep the fun cog for the hosted version of Sirbot (since this bot is mainly used for cat girl pictures lmao.) This version of Sirbot is in the 'fun' branch.

# Sirbot
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/sirspam/sirbot/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/sirspam/sirbot)

[Discord invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=822029618969182218&permissions=313408&scope=bot)

Sirbot's main function is interaction with the [ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com/) API, although it does feature some other functions. 

## How to use Sirbot
Sirbot's default prefix is **.** although a server admin can change this to a custom prefix. Mentioning the bot is also a valid prefix.

The rest of the bot is just your usual discord bot, put in the prefix then the command you want. "But what commands does Sirbot have?" I hearing you asking, well that leads us onto our next header, **Sirbot Commands**.

## Sirbot Commands
This'll be an excessively short list, so go grab some popcorn
### Help Commands
You know, commands for when you need help with Sirbot.
| Command | Description |

### Fun Commands
Clearly the best part about this bot, there are a lot more commands but I cannot be bothered to list them here, if you have a problem with that, cry about it. They are however listed in help Fun
